                <code>Pickling</code> is the process of preserving or extending the shelf life of food by either
                anaerobic
                fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar.
                The <code>Pickling</code> procedure typically affects the food's texture
                and flavor. The resulting food is called a pickle, or, to prevent ambiguity, prefaced with pickled.
                Foods that are pickled include vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, dairy and eggs.
            </p>
            <p>
                distinguishing characteristic is a pH of 4.6 or lower,which is sufficient to kill most bacteria.
                <code>Pickling</code> can preserve perishable foods for months. Antimicrobial herbs and spices, such as
                mustard seed,
                garlic, cinnamon or cloves, are often added.
                If the food contains sufficient moisture, a <code>Pickling</code> brine may be produced simply by adding
                dry salt.
                For example, sauerkraut and Korean kimchi are produced by salting the vegetables to draw out excess
                water. Natural fermentation at room temperature, by lactic acid bacteria, produces the required acidity.
                Other pickles are made by placing vegetables in vinegar.
                Like the canning process, <code>Pickling</code> (which includes fermentation) does not require that the
                food be
                completely sterile before it is sealed. The acidity or salinity of the solution, the temperature of
                fermentation, and the exclusion of oxygen determine which microorganisms dominate, and determine the
                flavor of the end product.

                South Asia has a large variety of pickles in Nepali, Assamese, Bengali,
                Hindi, Punjabi, Gujurati, Urdu uppinakaayi in Kannada, lonacha in Marathi,
                uppilittathu or achar in Malayalam, oorukai in Tamil, ooragaya in Telugu, which are mainly made from
                varieties of mango, lemon, lime, gongura (a sour leafy shrub), tamarind, Indian gooseberry (amla), and
                chilli. Vegetables such as eggplant, carrots, cauliflower, tomato, bitter gourd, green tamarind, ginger,
                garlic, onion, and citron are also occasionally used. These fruits and vegetables are generally mixed

                In Pakistan, pickles are known locally as achaar and come in a variety of flavours. A popular item is
                the traditional mixed Hyderabadi pickle, a common delicacy prepared from an assortment of fruits (most
                notably mangoes) and vegetables blended with selected spices. Although the origin of the word is
                ambiguous, the word āchār is widely considered to be of Persian origin. Āchār in Persian is defined as
                ‘powdered or salted meats, pickles, or fruits, preserved in salt, vinegar, honey, sugar or syrup.
            </p>

                Singapore, Indonesian and Malaysian pickles, called acar, are typically made out of cucumber, carrot,
                bird's eye chilies, and shallots, these items being seasoned with vinegar, sugar and salt. Fruits, such
                as papaya and pineapple, are also sometimes pickled.
                In the Philippines, <code>Pickling</code> is a common method of preserving food, with many commonly
                eaten foods
                pickled, traditionally done using large earthen jars. The process is known as buro or binuro.
                <code>Pickling</code>
                was a common method of preserving a large variety of foods like fish throughout the archipelago before
                the advent of refrigeration, but its popularity is now confined to vegetables and fruits. Atchara is
                primarily made out of julienned green papaya, carrots, and shallots, seasoned with cloves of garlic and
                vinegar; but could include ginger, bell peppers, white radishes, cucumbers or bamboo shoots. Pickled
                unripe mangoes or burong mangga, unripe tomatoes, guavas, jicama, bitter gourd and other fruit and
                vegetables still retain their appeal. Siling labuyo, sometimes with garlic and red onions, is also
                pickled in bottled vinegar and is a staple condiment in Filipino cuisine.

                In Vietnamese cuisine, vegetable pickles are called dưa muối ("salted vegetables") or dưa chua ("sour
                vegetables"). Dưa chua or dưa góp is made from a variety of fruits and vegetables, including cà pháo,
                eggplant, Napa cabbage, kohlrabi, carrots, radishes, papaya, cauliflower, and sung. Dưa chua made from
                carrots and radishes are commonly added to bánh mì sandwiches. Dưa cải muối is made by pressing and
                sun-drying vegetables such as cải bẹ xanh and bok choy. Nhút mít is a specialty of Nghệ An and Hã Tĩnh
                provinces made from jackfruit.

                In Hungary the main meal usually includes some kind of pickles, but pickles are
                also commonly consumed at other times of the day. The most commonly consumed pickles are sauerkraut
                , pickled cucumbers and peppers, and csalamádé, but tomatoes, carrots, beetroot, baby
                corn, onions, garlic, certain squashes and melons, and a few fruits like plums and apples are used to
                make pickles too. Stuffed pickles are specialties usually made of peppers or melons pickled after being
                stuffed with a cabbage filling. Pickled plum stuffed with garlic is a unique Hungarian type of pickle
                just like csalamádé and leavened cucumber. Csalamádé is a type of mixed pickle made of
                cabbage, cucumber, paprika, onion, carrot, tomatoes, and bay leaf mixed up with vinegar as the
                fermenting agent. Leavened cucumber, unlike other types of pickled cucumbers that are around all year
                long, is rather a seasonal pickle produced in the summer. Cucumbers, spices, herbs, and slices of bread
                are put in a glass jar with salt water and kept in direct sunlight for a few days. The yeast from the
                bread, along with other <code>Pickling</code> agents and spices fermented under the hot sun, give the
                cucumbers a
                unique flavor, texture, and slight carbonation. Its juice can be used instead of carbonated water to
                make a special type of spritzer. It is common for Hungarian households to produce
                their own pickles. Different regions or towns have their special recipes unique to them. Among them all
                the Vecsési sauerkraut is the most famous.

                turnips, celery and cauliflower. Meat, like pork, can also be preserved in salt and lard.
                Polish, Czech and Slovak traditional pickles are cucumbers, sauerkraut, peppers, beetroot, tomatoes, but
                other pickled fruits and vegetables, including plums, pumpkins and mushrooms are also common.

                sauerkraut, cucumbers, ramsons, garlic, eggplant (which is typically stuffed with julienned carrots),
                custard squash, and watermelon. Garden produce is commonly pickled using salt, dill, blackcurrant
                leaves, bay leaves and garlic and is stored in a cool, dark place. The leftover brine (called rassol
                in Russian) has a number of culinary uses in these countries, especially for cooking
                traditional soups, such as shchi, rassolnik, and solyanka. Rassol, especially cucumber or sauerkraut
                rassol, is also a favorite traditional remedy against morning hangover.

                "Pickle Rick" is the third episode of the third season of the Adult Swim animated television series Rick
                and Morty. Written by Jessica Gao and directed by Anthony Chun, the episode premiered on August 6, 2017.
                In "Pickle Rick", the eccentric scientist Rick Sanchez turns himself into a pickle just as he and his
                family are scheduled to attend a therapy session. The episode follows Rick's adventures as a pickle and
                the rest of the family's trip to therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The episode parodies action films and was inspired by the Breaking Bad episode "4 Days Out". In a
                continuation of the third season's storyline of Beth and Jerry's divorce, "Pickle Rick" explores Beth's
                unhealthy relationship with Rick and their views on intelligence and self-improvement. The episode was
                highly anticipated, with a rough cut animation premiering at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, and was
                watched by 2.3 million viewers when it first aired on Adult Swim.
            </p>
            <p>
                The episode received positive reviews, with critics praising the animation and design of Pickle Rick,
                the fight scenes, the performance of guest actor Danny Trejo (as Jaguar), and the episode's ending. It
                won Rick and Morty the 2018 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, the show's first Emmy
                Award. Several merchandise products, particularly of the character Pickle Rick, have been released.
